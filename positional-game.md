# Development of the Exercise: Guardiola’s 4v4+3 Kieran Smith

# The Exercise
- Type of exercise: Positional game
- Players needed: 11 players, 2 teams
- Timing: 17mins total (5’/1’/5’/1’/5’)
- Area size - 12x24 yards
- Exercise Organization The 3 neutral players maintain possession with the
  team on the outside. If/When the team with 4 players on the inside wins the
  ball, there is  a transitional moment in which they maintain possession with
  the neutral players and take up outside positions.

# Technical/Tactical Concepts

## Technical Aspects - Offensive
- Passing
- Control
- Movement to open passing lines
- Communication

## Tactical Concepts - Offensive
- Maintain possession
- Attract opposition to create space
- Passes to break lines
- Third man concept
- Up, back and through
- Positional width/depth
- Progression outside/inside
- Passing lines on different heights

## Technical Aspects - Defensive
- Body shape
- When to intercept or tackle
- Communication
- Pressure, cover, support

## Tactical Concepts - Defensive
- Transition from Attack to Defense
- Mentality change
- Closing the space
- Pressing
- Closing passing lines
- Defensive structure

### Initial standard when the exercise is new to players
- Lacks of speed and intensity for passes 
- Slow transitions
- Neither team maintains possession well

## Coaching the Concepts

- Attract the pressure to create space
Neutral player attracts pressure that creates space to progress using outside
players
- Maintain possession to create space centrally: Neutral player at one end uses
  outside player to create space for pass that breaks lines
- Up, back and through: Player in possession plays with closest player in order
  to free up space for deeper pass
- Third man concept: This is a key concept to the positional style of play & is
  the basis of the "triangles" on the pitch
- Attract the opposition to your zone to free deeper players: Maintain
  possession in close proximity in order to affect opposition & switch zone
- Defensive: Closing passing lines. Put pressure on the player in possesion
  while teammate moves to intercept
- Mentality change: Either after winning or losing the ball the speed of thought
  in change of mentality is vital

## Once the players understand the exercise
- Now we se the different in quality: After the concepts have been coached &
  repeatedly exercise, it can transfer to the game 
- Coaching reinforcement throughout: After time, we can have less stopages to
  coach but Guardiola is always giving feedback

## Anatomy of a goal. How we see the concepts during the match

This is where we can see the first of our concepts - attract the opposition so
we can progress on the outside and Swansea have fallen for the trap.
(picture annotations from left to right)
- This run pulls another Swansea player out of position creating more space
- By attracting the press, Man City have created space behind the line of
  pressure
- Man City CM gives the Swansea defender a "pressing tringer" by having his back
  to goal and this allows him to pull the Swansea player out of position
- Backwards movement to provide width & give passing line

Second and key concept - The up, back and through. Man City use it twice to
devastating effect. It allows them, not only to draw in Swansea, but to find the
deapeset available player with ease; which leads to the space for the goal
